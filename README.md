Codebase for My Masters' Thesis Project. 
This is the implementation of the paper for the Single point SIS Epidemic Model, where the data generated is Ill-conditioned. 
Hence, different techniques such as the Gradient Descent, Recursive Least Square, and the newly developed algorithm Greedy Recursive Least Square is tested.
